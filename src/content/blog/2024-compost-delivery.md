Hello, Fellow Gardeners.

Thank you for responding to the previous email sent to all MOBY Community Garden Members, ”This is your last opportunity to order your COMPOST.”

Important Notice:

We chose the Artisan Garden Group. https://artisangardengroup.com/  

It has been confirmed that the COMPOST delivery is this coming Saturday, April 28, 2024, at 8:00 AM sharp, and we are asking all members to help with the following:

If you have time, please prepare your plots before delivery. 
Please arrive on time at 8:00 AM to help with the delivery of the compost. 

If you have a strong friend, please bring them along to help with the wheelbarrows, which are full of compost. It would be helpful to our members in need.
