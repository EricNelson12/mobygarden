Hello to all our MOBY Community Garden Members;

Now that Spring has sprung, longer days bring milder weather and a sense of renewal for many of us, which is great for improving our health and well-being.

We will do plot renewals in-person on the following dates and times:
- Saturday, April 27th, 2024, from 12:00 Noon to 2:00 PM
- Sunday, April 28th, 2024, from 12:00 Noon to 2:00 PM

Any plots not renewed by Tuesday, April 30th, 2024, will be open to new gardeners. 
After new gardeners have their plots, we will offer any remaining plots to current gardeners.

Registration costs $30.00 *$25.00 per plot + $5.00 membership fee per person to cover insurance costs.*

For your convenience, you can choose to do either or both of the following options:
1. [Click here](https://forms.gle/bKQQRgqvwuaUkhDB8) to use our online MOBY Community Garden Registration Form

2. Complete the online MOBY Community Garden Registration Form and bring it to either registration day.
