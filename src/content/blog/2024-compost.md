Hello, Fellow Gardeners.
As we all know, the planting season is here, and registration is only a few weeks away.
Thank you to those who have already responded to the previous email sent to all MOBY Community Garden Members asking, “Do You Need More Soil For Your Garden Plot?"

For those who have yet to reply, please be advised that this is your last opportunity to order your COMPOST.
   
After spending much time and effort finding the right company and price to suit our needs, we have compiled the information listed below and decided to have the compost delivered and then be done with it.

We chose the Artisan Garden Group. https://artisangardengroup.com/

Artisan Garden Group has a well-regarded product *Black Gold*, an organic vegetable growing mix.

They provide compost to many local community gardens, Master Gardeners, and the City of Vancouver Green Streets program.

- The organic compost will be 1/3 the price of any bagged compost.

- The more people buy in, the cheaper it gets by the barrow-full.

- If we have a full delivery, it will be $7 a wheelbarrow.

- Six wheelbarrows will cover each plot with 3” of compost.

To deliver the Compost by **April 26th or 27th, 2024**, you must respond to Patrick no later than <span style="color:red">**Wednesday, April 24th**</span>.
